the Database class in db.py does the talking to the database.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# YOUR TASK (part 2 of 2): implement the login endpoint.
# (Part 1 is get_login_info in db.py. Write that first.)
#
# 1. Uncomment the Login class below, and the api.add_resource line for it in
#    setup_auth (at the bottom of this file).
# 2. Read the username and password from the JSON body. Look at how Register
#    does this, including what it does when a field is missing.
# 3. Use get_db().get_login_info(username) to look up the user.
# 4. If no user came back, OR check_password_hash(stored_hash, password) says
#    the password is wrong, return {"message": BAD_LOGIN_MESSAGE}, 401
#    Use the same message for both cases. Why? (Hint: what could an attacker
#    learn if "no such user" and "wrong password" were different messages?)
# 5. On success, return a 200 response whose "message" welcomes the user back
#    by their display name and tells them when they last logged in.
#    Careful: last_login is NULL in the database (None in Python) the very
#    first time someone logs in.
#
# Bonus: after a successful login, call the update_last_login method you
#        wrote in db.py.
